This update brings a way-too-fully-featured winemaking system to firmalife! So big I didn't have time to write field guide docs for it! Enjoy discovering the new world of wine. The long wait for this update also means that it comes with all the other bugfixes and tweaks that I usually release more regularly in a complete package.

### Winemaking Overview

- Added red and white grape plants. They can be found in the wild looking like berry bushes.
- Grape trellises are formed from grape trellis posts stacked two high. Right click these with jute fiber to string rope between them.
- Click a jute string that is above a dirt-based block to plant a grape plant.
- The grape plant will grow over time over the trellis and then that part can be harvested.
- Grape plants take into account the characteristics of the surrounding environment when made into wine.
- Grapes can be grown in a greenhouse on trellises.
- Grapes can be stomped on in a stomping barrel, fermented in a barrel, and pressed in a barrel press.
- Red grapes = red wine, White grapes = white wine, white grapes + at least one red = Rose, White wine + sugar = dessert wine
- Wine bottles are made of non-silica glass. Wine glasses are made of silica glass.
- You need corks. You can also make bottle labels if you wish.
- Wine begins aging as soon as it is bottled from the barrel press until the cork is popped off with a knife.
- Wine can be stored on wine shelves.

### Beehive Update
- Allow insert/extract without using the GUI
- Completely revamped the GUI to look prettier.
- There are now barrel-like slots in the beehive that can be used to extract honey without leaving the GUI.
- Improved hopper interactivity of the beehive.
- Reduced clutter in jade
- Replaced bee particles with entities

### Other Features
- Added kegs, 2x2x2 barrels that store loads of liquid and items. And also look cool.
- Allow gui-less insert and extract for beehives
- Allow extracting logs from bottom ovens
- Reduced chromite rarity again.

### Fixes
- Fix missing slab/stair/wall tags for rustic and tile blocks, and metal blocks
- Change bee temperature translation key
